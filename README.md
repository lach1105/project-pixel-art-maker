# Pixel Art Maker Project
A single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas.  Customization occurs through user input related to grid width, grid height, and color.

## Installation
Open `index.html` in web browser.

## Initial Setup
1. Set **Grid Height** to a value between 1 and 50.
2. Set **Grid Width** to a value between 1 and 50.
3. Change default color by clicking on the colored box located under **Pick a color**.
4. Clicking **Submit** at this point will create the **Design Canvas** of the size indicated by the **Grid Height** and **Grid Width**.

## Usage
- Click inside a single canvas grid square to change its color to that indicated by the currently chosen color.
- The color can be changed at any time by using the same procedure described in step 3 above.
- Continue clicking and color changes to create an art piece of your choosing.

### Resetting the Design Canvas
Clicking **Submit** again will clear all colored grid squares and create a new **Design Canvas** matching the **Grid Size** parameters.
